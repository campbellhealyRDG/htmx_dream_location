Setting HTMX Attributes Dynamically (On The Client)

In the previous lecture, you learned how to dynamically generate & set HTMX attributes on the server.

You can also do that on the client, with help of client-side JavaScript.

But there's one important thing to note & keep in mind: Unlike on the server, the client-side code will execute after the page was loaded and therefore after HTMX checked for known attributes.

Therefore, whenever you dynamically set or change HTMX attributes with help of client-side JavaScript code, HTMX will ignore those attributes (or, to be precise: It simply won't detect them).

Hence you must make HTMX aware of those attributes. And you can do that manually, by calling htmx.process(elementWithNewAttributes) in your JavaScript code (e.g., right after the code that added an HTMX attribute).

Here's an example:

    <script>
      const button = document.querySelector("button"); 
      button.setAttribute("hx-get", "/data");
      htmx.process(button);
    </script>

htmx is a globally available variable that's added by HTMX.
